# jssimplebuild
A simple build system for testing small scripts in the browser

## Installation
1.  Go to your ~/Public directory and run `git clone https://github.com/willfulbard/jssimplebuild.git`
3.  Copy the `jssimplebuild` script to somewhere in your `$PATH` (like `/usr/local/bin`, which you'll probably need admin permissions for)
4.  If using Sublime Text:
  1.  Copy `jssimplebuild.sublime-build` to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/`
  3.  Select jssimplebuild from `Tools -> Build System`
5.  If using vim, add the lines in `javascript.vim` to your .vimrc or copy it into your `~/.vim/ftplugins/javascript.vim` file.
6.  Enjoy using Cmd-b or :make respectively!
