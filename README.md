# jssimplebuild
A simple build system for testing small scripts in the browser

## Installation

2.  If using Sublime Text:
  1.  Copy `jssimplebuild.sublime-build` to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/`
  2.  Copy the `jssimplebuild` script to somewhere in your `$PATH` (like `/usr/local/bin`, which you'll probably need admin permissions for)
  3.  Select jssimplebuild from `Tools -> Build System`
3.  If using vim, add the lines in `javascript.vim` to your .vimrc or copy it into your `~/.vim/ftplugins/javascript.vim` file.
